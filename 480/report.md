## Date Source  
I found my data on Kaggle and it looks at heart disease prediction and predicting the probability of heart disease in patients. It explores things such as age, cholesterol, EKG results, thallium, etc.

## Research Question  
My research question states: **What is the average age of someone with heart disease?**

## Target Variable  
My target variable was **age**.

## Data Cleaning  
I did not clean the data.

## Description of the Training Process and Model Evaluation  
I allowed Canvas to train the given data and handle the model evaluation, because we could not train it for an ample amount of time it is not the best form of data analysis.

## Model Performance  
It performed well and was visually clean and understandable given the dataset. However, the model could be more accurate in the future as there was a low correlation.
